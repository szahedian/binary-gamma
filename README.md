# Impossibility theorems involving weakenings of expansion consistency and resoluteness in voting

README.md for the code used in the paper [Impossibility theorems involving weakenings of expansion consistency and resoluteness in voting
](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.06907) by Wesley H. Holliday, Eric Pacuit, and Saam Zahedian.  


## Notebooks

The two main notebooks that contain the proofs of Propositions A.12 and B.3: 

1. Majoritarian.ipynb: This notebooks contains the proof of Proposition A.12 using a SAT solver. 

2. Pairwise.ipynb: This notebooks contains the proof of Proposition B.3. using a SAT solver. 


The following notebooks contain the code to reproduce generation of the canonical (weighted) tournaments and finding a minimal set of (weighted) tournaments needed for the impossibility theorems: 

1. CanonicalObjects.ipynb: This notebook shows how to generate the canonical weak tournaments and canonical weighted tournaments.    

2. MinSetTournaments.ipynb: This notebook shows how to find minimal sets of graphs needed to provied Propositions A.12 and B.3.


## Other Files/Directories

## Requirements

All the code is written in Python 3. The notebooks use the following libraries: 

- [Preferential Voting Tools](https://pref-voting.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
- The notebooks and the pref_voting library is built around a full SciPy stack: [MatPlotLib](https://matplotlib.org/), [Numpy](https://numpy.org/), [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), [numba](http://numba.pydata.org/), [networkx](https://networkx.org/), and [tabulate](https://github.com/astanin/python-tabulate)
- [tqdm.notebook](https://github.com/tqdm/tqdm)
- [PySAT](https://pysathq.github.io/)

```python

```
